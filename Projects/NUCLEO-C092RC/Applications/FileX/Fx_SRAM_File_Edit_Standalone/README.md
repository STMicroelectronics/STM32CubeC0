## <b>Fx_SRAM_File_Edit_Standalone Application Description</b>

This application provides an example of FileX stack usage on NUCLEO-C092RC board, running in standalone mode (without ThreadX). It demonstrates how to create a Fat File system on the internal SRAM memory using FileX.

The application is designed to execute file operations on the SRAM-Disk device, it provides all required software code for properly managing it.

The application's main calls the MX_FileX_Process() function that handles file operations. At this stage, all FileX resources are created and the SRAM driver is initialized. After that, the MX_FileX_Process will start by formatting the SRAM-Disk using FileX services. The resulting file system is a FAT32 compatible, with 128 bytes per sector.

Upon successful opening of the created SRAM-Disk media, FileX continue with creating a file called "STM32.TXT" into the root directory, then write into it some predefined data. Then file is re-opened in read only mode and content is checked.

As stated earlier, the present application runs in standalone mode without ThreadX, for this reason, the standalone variant of fileX is used, plus the following flags need to be set in fx_user.h:

    #define FX_SINGLE_THREAD
    #define FX_STANDALONE_ENABLE

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

Successful operation is marked by a toggling green LED light.

Also, information regarding executing operation on the SRAM-Disk is printed to the serial port.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

On failure, an error message is printed to the serial port while the green LED is switched OFF.

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>
None

#### <b>Known limitations</b>
None

### <b>Notes</b>
 1. The created SRAM-Disk, is placed in SRAM (12KB) starting from the (FX_SRAM_DISK_BASE_ADDRESS=@0x20001900).
 2. The size of the custom sector used in the application is 128 bytes instead of the standard 512 bytes.
 3. To optimize the application footprint, the following FileX configuration options should be enabled in the fx_user.h file:

    #define FX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING

    #define FX_MEDIA_STATISTICS_DISABLE

    #define FX_DISABLE_FAST_OPEN

    #define FX_DISABLE_BUILD_OPTIONS

    #define FX_DISABLE_ONE_LINE_FUNCTION

    #define FX_DISABLE_CONSECUTIVE_DETECT

 4. Also for optimization purposes, in STM32CubeIDE project Debug mode, the Optimization level should be set to "Optimize for Debug (-Og)".

#### <b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b>

- When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a valid filesystem.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This application runs on STM32C092xx devices.
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-C092RC boards revision MB2046-C092RC_S-B02
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - This application uses USART2 to display logs, the hyperterminal configuration is as follows:

      - BaudRate = 115200 baud
      - Word Length = 8 Bits
      - Stop Bit = 1
      - Parity = None
      - Flow control = None

###  <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
