## <b>PWR_STANDBY Example Description</b>

How to enter the Standby mode and wake up from this mode by using an external reset or the WKUP pin.

The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick
interrupt handler, LED1 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in Standby or Run mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the EXTI line, an interrupt is generated and the system wakes up
the program then checks and clears the standby flag.
After clearing the standby flag, the software enables wake-up pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 connected to PC.13, then
the corresponding flag indicating that a wakeup event was received from the PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 is cleared.
Finally, the system enters again Standby mode causing LED1 to stop toggling.

A falling edge on WKUP pin will wake-up the system from Standby.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.The application needs to ensure that the SysTick

After wake-up from Standby mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET and LED1 restarts toggling.

Two leds LED1 and LED2 are used to monitor the system state as follows:

 - LED2 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in Run mode
 - LED1 off : system in Standby mode

#### <b>Notes</b>

   1. To measure the current consumption in Standby mode, please refer to
      @subpage PWR_CurrentConsumption example.

   2. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

   3. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
