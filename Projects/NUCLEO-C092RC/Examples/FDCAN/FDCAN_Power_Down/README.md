## <b>FDCAN_Power_Down Example Description</b>

This example describes the functionality of the power down mode in the FDCAN peripheral.

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals and initialize the systick used as 1ms HAL timebase.

Then the *SystemClock_Config()* function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.

The example is divided into several sections:<br>

  - In the first section, the *HAL_FDCAN_Init()* function is called to configure the module in external loopback mode,  with a **Nominal Bit Rate of 1 MBit/s** and a **sampling point at 75%**.<br>
    Additionally, it has a **Data Bit Rate of 2 MBit/s** and a **sampling point at 75%**.<br>
    Reception filters are then configured with *HAL_FDCAN_ConfigFilter()*, to receive:<br>
      - messages with pre-defined standard ID to Rx FIFO 0<br>

    Then FDCAN module is started with *HAL_FDCAN_Start()*.<br>
  - In section 2, the following messages is sent:<br>
      - one standard ID message matching Rx FIFO 0 filter<br>
    The application then checks that the message was received and as expected.
  - In section 3, the FDCAN module enters power down mode.
  - In section 4, the application tries to send an FDCAN message, and checks that it remains pending until power down mode is excited.
  - In section 5, the FDCAN clock is disabled. At this point, the energy consumption is a bit reduced as the module is in power down mode.
  - In section 6, the application exits power down mode of the FDCAN module and re-enable it's clock.
  - In section 7, the application checks the message was received and as expected, indicating that the power down mode did not interfere with the FDCAN configuration.

The FDCAN peripheral configuration is ensured by the *HAL_FDCAN_Init()* function.
This later is calling the *HAL_FDCAN_MspInit()* function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed FDCAN resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO, NVIC and DMA).
User may update this function to change FDCAN configuration.


NUCLEO-C092RC's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:

  - LED1 is ON when all messages were successfully transmitted and received.
  - LED2 toggle slowly when there is an error in transmission/reception process.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
