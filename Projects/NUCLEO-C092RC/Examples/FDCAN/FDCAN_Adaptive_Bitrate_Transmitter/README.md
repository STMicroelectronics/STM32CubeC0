## <b>FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Transmitter Example Description</b>

This example describes how to configure the FDCAN peripheral to adapt to different CAN bit rates using restricted mode.

> **_NOTE:_**  This example needs an external FDCAN transceiver: **MIKROE** - [**MCP2542 CLICK**](https://www.mikroe.com/mcp2542-click).

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals and initialize the systick used as 1ms HAL timebase.

Then the *SystemClock_Config()* function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.

The example is divided into several steps:<br>

  - In the first step, the FDCAN module is configured to operate at a **Nominal Bit Rate of 1 MBit/s** and a **sampling point at 75%**, by calling *HAL_FDCAN_Init()*.<br>
    This is the bitrate that the other board running "FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Receiver" example needs to find.
    Reception filter is configured with *HAL_FDCAN_ConfigFilter()* to receive messages with pre-defined standard ID and put it in Rx FIFO 0.<br>
    Interruptions are configured with *HAL_FDCAN_ActivateNotification()*.
    Then, the FDCAN module is started with *HAL_FDCAN_Start()*.<br>
  - In the second step, the application transmits a CAN message in a loop with *HAL_FDCAN_AddMessageToTxFifoQ()* for the receiver board to receive it.<br>

  - If an acknowledge message was received, the application ends and LED1 stays ON.
  - If the transmitter bitrate was not found, or the message is not correctly received, or if at any time of the process an error is encountered, LED2 starts blinking.

The FDCAN peripheral configuration is ensured by the *HAL_FDCAN_Init()* function.
This later is calling the *HAL_FDCAN_MspInit()* function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed FDCAN resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO, NVIC and DMA).
User may update this function to change FDCAN configuration.


NUCLEO-C092RC's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:

  - LED1 is ON when the acknowledge message is received as expected.
  - LED2 toggle slowly when there is an error in transmission/reception process.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32C092RCTx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-C092RC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-C092RC Set-up:
    - FDCAN RX/TX signals can be accessed through the Arduino or morpho connector.<br>
      To use this example, please connect an external FDCAN transceiver to these pins.<br>
      This example has been tested with [**MCP2542 CLICK**](https://www.mikroe.com/mcp2542-click) CAN FD transceiver module from MIKROE.<br>

      To connect the module, please follow these wiring indications:<br>
      - Connect GND, 5V **and** 3V3 on the MCP2545 CLICK board.
      - Connect MCP2545 CLICK **TX** pin to FDCAN **RX** pin PD0.
      - Connect MCP2545 CLICK **RX** pin to FDCAN **TX** pin PD1.

      This must also be done for the other board, running the FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Receiver example.
      Both MCP2545 CLICK must be connected to each other using a CAN-FD cable.
    - A 120-ohm termination resistor must be connected on one of the boards by placing the JP9 jumper.

    

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Rebuild all files from this example "FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Transmitter" and load your image into target memory of board A.
  - Rebuild all files from other example "FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Receiver" and load your image into target memory of board B.
  - Connect both CAN-FD connectors from each board setup, with a CAN-FD cable.
  - Run the examples on each board, ensuring that **"FDCAN_Adaptive_Bitrate_Transmitter" is the first one to be executed**.
