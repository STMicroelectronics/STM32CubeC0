## <b>Templates_Board Example Description</b>

This project provides a reference template for the NUCLEO-C092RC board based on the STM32Cube HAL API and the
BSP drivers that can be used to build any firmware application.

It was created from STM32CubeMX using the 'Start My project from ST board' feature.

This template shows how to use the BSP drivers for the leds, user push-button and VCP COM port of the NUCLEO-C092RC
board thanks to BSP resources initialization and demonstration codes:

  - BSP Led: LED_GREEN and LED_BLUE are initialized and switched on.

  - BSP Push-button: BUTTON_USER is initialized in interrupt mode and each key-press is detected through
    the corresponding EXTI4_15_IRQHandler(). Led is toggled at each key press.

  - BSP COM:  Virtual COM port associated to ST-LINK is initialized and used to redirect the C library printf(). 
    As an example it outputs the "Welcome to STM32 world !\n\r" message on a terminal.
    The USART is configured as follows:
      - Baudrate = 115200 bps
      - Word length = 8 bits (7-data bit + 1 stop bit)
      - One stop bit
      - No parity
      - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to initialize the systick used as 1ms HAL timebase.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 Mhz.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This template runs on STM32C092xx devices.

  - This template has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-C092RC
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
