## <b>TIM_DMA_Init Example Description</b>

Use of the DMA with a timer update request 
to transfer data from memory to Timer Capture Compare Register 3 (TIMx_CCR3). This 
example is based on the STM32C0xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The following configuration values are used in this example:

  - TIM1CLK = SystemClock
  - Counter repetition = 3 
  - Prescaler = 0 
  - TIM1 counter clock = SystemClock
  - SystemCoreClock is set to 48 MHz for STM32C0xx Devices.

The objective is to configure TIM1 channel 3 to generate PWM edge aligned 
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz, and a variable duty cycle that
is changed by the DMA after a specific number of Update DMA request.

The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM1 Repetition counter,
each 4 Update Requests, the TIM1 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
value defined by the aCCValue buffer.

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

Whenever a DMA transfer fails LED4 flashes with a frequency of 1 Hz.
 
#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. PWM signal frequency value mentioned above is theoretical (obtained when
    the system clock frequency is exactly 48 MHz). Since the generated system
    clock frequency may vary from one board to another observed PWM signal
    frequency might be slightly different.
