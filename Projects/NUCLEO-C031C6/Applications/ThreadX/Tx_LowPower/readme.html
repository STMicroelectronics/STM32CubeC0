<h2><b>Tx_LowPower application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS ThreadX stack usage, it shows how to develop an application using ThreadX low power feature. The main entry function tx_application_define() is then called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, the application creates 1 thread and 1 semaphore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MainThread (Prio : 10; Preemption Threshold : 10)</p></li>
<li><p>Semaphore (Initial count = 0 to prevent its acquisition by the MainThread, on the application start)</p></li>
<li><p>‘MainThread’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main thread tries to acquire the ‘Semaphore’.</li>
<li>On Success toggles the ‘GREEN LED’ each 500 ms for 5 secs.</li>
<li>On Failure it switches to supended mode waiting for the ‘Semaphore’ to be released.</li>
<li>The steps above are repeated indefinitely.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When the “MainThread” is in suspended state, waiting for the ‘Semaphore’, the system is in idle state and the scheduler decides to enter in low power mode by calling the TX_LOW_POWER_USER_ENTER that makes the system enter the STOP Mode via the HAL_PWR_EnterSTOPMode() API.</p>
<p>As soon as the User button is pressed, the ‘Semaphore’ is released, and the ‘MainThread’ passes in Active state.</p>
<p>The scheduler exits the STOP Mode by calling the TX_LOW_POWER_EXIT.</p>
<p>In System STOP Mode, all I/O pins keep the same state as in Run mode.</p>
<p>When exiting the STOP Mode, the MCU is in Run mode (Range 1 or Range 2 depending on VOS bit in PWR_CR1).</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><b>tx_low_power_enter()</b> service enters low power mode. For keeping track of time while in low power mode, there are two possibilities:</p>
<p>1.1. A ThreadX timer is active: Function <strong>tx_timer_get_next</strong> returns <strong>TX_TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that in this situation, a low power clock must be used in order to wake up the CPU for the next ThreadX timer expiration.</p>
<p>Therefore an alternative clock must be programmed. Program the hardware timer source such that the next timer interrupt is equal to: <em>tx_low_power_next_expiration</em> tick_frequency. The <em>tick_frequency</em> is application-specific and typically set up in <strong>tx_low_level_initialize</strong>.</p>
<p>1.2. There are no ThreadX timers active: Function <strong>tx_timer_get_next</strong> returns <strong>TX_FALSE</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>1.2.1. The application may choose not to keep the ThreadX internal
tick count updated (define **TX_LOW_POWER_TICKLESS**), therefore there is no need
to set up a low power clock.

1.2.2. The application still needs to keep the ThreadX tick up-to-date. In this case a low power clock needs to be set up.</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Entering Low-power mode through WFI will be executed only if no interrupt is pending.</p></li>
<li><p>The Debug Module must be stopped during STOP Mode, otherwise, It will generate interrupts that cause the Wake-up of the system immediately after entering the STOP Mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The user push-button interrupt priority must be set to the highest possible value, otherwise, after exiting STOP Mode the processor will not execute the interrupt handler.</p></li>
<li>To optimize the application footprint, the following ThreadX configuration options should be enabled in the tx_user.h file:</li>
<pre><code>#define TX_DISABLE_PREEMPTION_THRESHOLD
#define TX_DISABLE_NOTIFY_CALLBACKS
#define TX_DISABLE_REDUNDANT_CLEARING
#define TX_DISABLE_STACK_FILLING
#define TX_NOT_INTERRUPTABLE
#define TX_TIMER_PROCESS_IN_ISR
#define TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING</code></pre>
</ol>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the “TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in “tx_initialize_low_level.S” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li><p>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file: <code>place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></p></li>
<li><p>For MDK-ARM: <code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the ".sct" file  or modify the line below in "tx_initialize_low_level.S" to match the memory region being used      LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></p></li>
<li><p>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file: <code>._threadx_heap :    {       . = ALIGN(8);       __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;       . = . + 64K;       . = ALIGN(8);     } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></p>
<p>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above. In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes. The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script. Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example). Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: “Linker script”.</p></li>
<li><p>The “tx_initialize_low_level.S” should be also modified to enable the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</p></li>
